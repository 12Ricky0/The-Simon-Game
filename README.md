# The-Simon-Game
Simon Game

This project is a clone of the Simon-Game which is an electronic game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978. The game has four colored buttons, each producing a different tone when pressed: red, green, blue, and yellow. The game randomly generates a sequence of tones, which the player must memorize and repeat by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order.

The game starts with a sequence of one tone, and each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds another tone to the end of the sequence, making the game progressively more challenging. The game ends when the player makes an incorrect sequence.
