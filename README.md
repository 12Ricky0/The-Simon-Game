Simon Game

Simon is an electronic game invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison in 1978. The game has four colored buttons, each producing a different tone when pressed: red, green, blue, and yellow. The game randomly generates a sequence of tones, which the player must memorize and repeat by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order.
